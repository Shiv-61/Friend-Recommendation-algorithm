# Friend-Recommendation-algorithm
The Social Network Friend Recommendation System is a C++ implementation that simulates a basic social network where users can be friends with each other. The project uses graph theory to represent users as nodes and friendships as edges. The goal of the system is to recommend potential friends to a user based on the concept of "friends of friends."
